What's important in distinguishing data scientists/analyst?
	- through tons of research: bodies of work
	- distinguishing between Sr. and Jr. candidate
		- Freshers: Jr. guy knows all about the theory

		weak implementation skills
		
		- Kagglers: knows the model fitting stage

		Doesn't understand the most difficult aspect of data science which isn't the math. It's taking a vague ambiguous business problem and apply technical context to it. 

		weak application and implementation skills

		- Bootcampers: knows only how to import packages, knows nothing about theory. 

		Constrained by toolkits and whatever's in the wheelhouse of it. If it can't be cleanly applied to I/O of a package.

		weak fundamentals

		- business chops
		- non-practical: bias towards a particualr tech because it's in vogue or someting.


How can I skill myself up?
	see (i) below projects/tasks should uncomfortable avoid complacency of living in comfort zone AT ALL COSTs



Project choice?
	i) it must intimidate you but to the point where it's paralyzing.
	
	ii) task-selection for grad student

		grad student example

	iii) external validation early and often:

		Why it's important to ship and expose the imperfect solution early? to get feedback immediately 

		e.g. project choice and draft of the project

	iv) scope every phase of the project and time block

	v) rank order tasks according cognitive energy levels throughout the day. 
		- carve out early morning hours (makes a big difference)
		- sundays
		- DO NOT try evenings
		- Avoid the danger of additive schedule syndrome
		- over scoping things at work for exploration UNLESS you have a deadline. Always have a bias to the MVP and come back to it later.

	working on the go strategies:
		- think while you walk, park, or a place that deosn't involve a lot of concious thought
		- on the go with a phone, while waiting in line.

	rules of the thumb:
		- consistency, is the key
		- never juggle more than 3 projects at once
		- learn to plan or plan to fail
		- health: sleep, eat, drink, exercise right
		- disconnect
		- know your weaknesses and how to mitigate them and play to your strengths

How can I showcase my portfolio of work? 
	- All on LinkedIn, skip even github and blogs at this point.

How can I display projects at work and display it publicly?
	- Get in the habit of doing things until someone tells you not to: "It's better to ask for forgiveness, than permission"
