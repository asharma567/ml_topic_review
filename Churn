Defining a cohort
	basically finding something in common about a group of users. e.g. sign-up date, first month's purchase, birth-date, acquisition, first purchase ever.

Defining a key metric to track over time
	usually a sales, usage metric eg. booking a trip for lyft uber or airbnb, or just signing on to thier app.

How did you cohort analysis with bonds?
	Bonds from different companies that were issued at a certain date and just track thier performance fixing on one metric in my case what percentage of the bond as paid down.
	Obviously you want to be good about fixing as many variables as possible to avoid bias. Cohort analysis followed by a prediction model that took time-series data from the prior months.

Taking snapshots of different time periods lets say months in our case my also be a worthy approach.

Can I fit this into a the cab analysis thing
