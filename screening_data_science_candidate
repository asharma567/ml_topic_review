Screening a data science candidate
-----------------------------------

Ideally you should hire a data scientist according to your needs. That is if she's going to building systems and recommender engines, then you'd want to hire someone that's more of a machine learning engineering. That is, a data scientist with a strong engineering slant to them. If the needs are more about client interaction then more than MBA type would be necessary.

When designing it a take-home it should surface these competency areas as much as possible.

skills

- scoping

everything below but greater emphasis on the respective stuff.

builder (codes for machines)
- productionization skills
- model deployment
- big (o) notation
- designing api best practices
- clean/flexible code


mba / analytical type (codes for people)
- communication of technical detail
- notebook with qauntitative to qaulitative analysis
- presentation skills
- visualization
- causal inference
- experimental design



Interviewing Flow:

preface the job descriptions about not inflating their resume as it we're just trying to accurately measure str/weaknesses (yes! it's okay to have them :-)

Initial (recruiter/hr) -> 

pedigree, ethusiasm (why do you want work for us?)

Tech screen (30 mins)
	Directory traverse question) 
		bash skills, native python skills

	Past work, professional or side-projects)
		dive in technically and have them explain
		and also question them on, Theory, like why'd you guys use this model versus that one. 
		how'd you measure success of this project
		how was it prioritized

Take-home
	Duration:
	couched as 3 hours long but in reality it would take over a weekend.

	Types of take-homes:

	ideally the takehome would reflect the project you're looking to hire them for. That way there's minimal slippage from thier performance on the take-home and they're performance at work.

	mba / analytical type
	"Find some random Insights and present" Don't do this you lazy asshole but it does test some level creativity.

	builder
	train a model and wrap it in a flask app.

	we're going to ask them to tackle the corpus of complaints. 

	deliverable: analysis and -- based on discovery in analysis --  scope into productionization roadmap
