What different types of transformations to random variables?
    - The optimal type of transformation is found using the box-cox test
        -.1 is a reciprocal
        -.5 is a reciprocal square root
        0.0 is log transformation
        .5 is a square root transformation
        1.0 no transformation

    - 0 mean
        What is this?
            this is centering the data. basically you're centering the data around 0 
        Why is it done?
            it's done in efforts to normalize the distribution such that it's scale invariant.
        How would you explain this to a business unit?
            in stats and ml it makes the algorithm converge faster but more importantly from a intrepretation perspective it allows use to make statements like holding all other variables fixed one unit increase in x affects y by amount z on average.
        How is this performed?
            looping through each observations and subtracting the (sample mean). In the feature space.

    - unit variance
        scales the data such that it 

    - log transformation

    - linear transformations
        - adding a constant Y = X + b
        - dividing by a constant Y = X/b 
        - multiplying by a constant Y = Xm
        - any combination of the above Y = mX + b
        
        - OLS is an example of a transformation
            - you're fitting a line to the data by two seperate ways
            - OLS finds it's optimal parameters (weights) by way of normal equation. The normal equation is a linear tranformation on the data s.t. it yields the parameters for the best fit line. Though it's time complexity is O(n^3). The normal equation is a linear transformation of the matrix added with an intercept component. constraints are the matrix has to be full-rank. No multicollinearity.
