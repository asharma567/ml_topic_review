What are popular methods of customer segmentation?

Cluster validation?
	- probablistic metrics:
		using an mixmodel see where the data points fit into a certain cluster
	
	- ssq:
		minimization of the sum of squares to the centroid, which is how k-means work but it's terrible for intra-cluster validation.
	
	- silhouette co-efficient:

	- intra-cluster/inter-cluster variation:
		eg. gap statistic

All the clustering methods?
	- guassian mixture model
	- Hieararchal clustering if you wanted to get a semantic reference to the taxonomy of clusters it forms. Agglomerative and top-down methods. 
	- k-means for data summarization. Distance based hence it segments the space
		-k-mode
		-k-mediods
		-k-minibatch
	- db-scan for noise removal, density based, it finds the densities.
	- sprectral clustering
	- graph-based for community detection
	- power iteration cluster
	- Birch
	- TSNE for visualization
	
	- NMF joint with some clustering method for collabarotive filtering
	- k-means

Hierarchical Clustering
-----
gives you a taxonomy of how the data segments, there are designs for it to be top-down or bottom-up with different trade-offs for each though I believe the bottom-up approach tends to be more accurate


Ways of finding k in k-means?
	- gap
	- elbow as k-increases find the elbow of some minimal variation score

dbscan versus k-means?
	dbscan basically sits on top of a NN search and forms clusters that way
	
difference between hierarchical clustering?
noise removal with clustering?

what are some features you could create with clustering?

use cases:
	- cust segmentation
	- collaborative filtering
	- community detection in a network analysis
	- data summarization

What are different methods of feature selection?
** a key error I've been making is studying/orating feature selection as it pertains only to supervised methods i.e. feature importance


Can you grid-search penalty parameters?
