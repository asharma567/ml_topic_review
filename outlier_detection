Supervised approach versus MA, ARMA, etc
-----------------------------------------
- ARMA and such will detect outlier based on the error it produces based on it's window and hence might not be enough to distinguish between anomaly and noise.


This method involves learning all the error terms from something like arma or arima, centering the data to Z-vals or something then looking at the tails of the distribution and coming up with an alarm threshold.

- primary abnormal events: true anomalies
- secondary abnormal events: noise 

The problem of capturing the entire sequence is still a problem eg flash crash. How can you spot such an unusual shape. You need a reference of what is normal to compare to. This becomes a challenge.

What is pruning?
	- basically trimmnig the TS for outliers

Transformations to other representations--
	- vectorize the entire time series via Ni
