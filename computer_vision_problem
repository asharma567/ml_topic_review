Business problem:
	- eBay for homes: time intensive on the ops team.
	- image quality correlating to the success of a home-sale. unsuprisingly there was some correlation.
	- providing recommendations to people who post thier properties
	- condition assessment

Tell me about your computer vision project.
	- I was inundated working on other projects so I couldn't give it my full attention but it was a problem the other data scientists on my team have been trying to figure out for months. So, while I was on my 2-weeker, I thought of a solution.

	- They playing around with the idea of using a linear model called elastic net and featurizing builind out a feature matrix -- traditional methods. After months of getting sub-par results I decided to step in and give it a shot.

	- I started by doing some research about it on my vacation and then seeing that NNs were the best solution to this problem and what great opportunity to learn a bit more about deeplearning. So while on my vacation, I proposed a strategy-plan on execution to my boss, he loved it. I was assigned to the problem and built an awesome conv net which is something I'll do for your team as well.

	- I did have some background in deeplearning though from NLP and I also had some footing with the canonical hand written digits problem.

	- After leaving the company the Sr. Data Scientist was so happy he gave me a recommendation about it

Phases:
	- research: figuring out the nuances of each package and a lot of scoping.
	- data gathering 
	- infrastructural buildout
	- proper evaluation techniques
	- figuring out how to make the model stronger

	- configuring your local machine to be gpu enabled was one of the biggest bottlenecks
	- manually gathering the hold out set
	- stumbling into TSNE

How would you have done the computer vision project differently?

	- I definitely would've used tensorflow. 
		why?
			- it solves a lot the deployment issues I spoke earlier about
			- documentation is far superior to anything I've seen

			- I think I would've done it all over AWS. Maybe prototyped locally and then done it over AWS.

You majored in Math but followed a CS track.

i) I need to know about your use-case then I could helpout.

	The platform measures data related to how mitigated motor vehicle traffic affects resident behavior such as walking, bicycling and using public transportation.

ii) What I'm actually even more interested in is the infrastructure for real-time analysis. 

iii) What's your timeline for the role?

- couple of weeks, implementation month, deployment

iv) How is the model to be delivered?

wireless sesnsor systems
camera, 
what objects are there and where in the they're 
feature extractor, and boosted decision trees
multiclass 
identify pedastrians, bicyclist, strollers, cars, trucks, vehicle

1) classify image 2) bound the object 3) integration
