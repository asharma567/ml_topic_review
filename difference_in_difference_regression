difference in difference regression?
WNI?
	Wonderful New Intervention, place holder for some type of new feature implementing which hopefully leads to a lift in X

parallel trends?

begs the question why not just take a control vs treatment and just track that over time?

 add some autocorrelation to individual classes?
 what does each class represent? group of folks?
 and do we seriously assume the scores are normally distributed?

 what's this avg_lm_scores?

 Schedule some tiem to go over his other post of flights



 			why does he do this twice instead of just adding it all once?

            # If it's in the treatment group, then the class will improve by an average of 8
            # Learner Mastery points after Launch Day
            lm_boost = np.random.normal(8, 2, num_months)*wni_launched
 
            # We're also going to give all treatment classes a 5-point Learner Mastery
            # boost because we assume they're naturally better somehow (perhaps because they're
            # taught by more motivated instructors)
            lm_boost += np.random.normal(5, 1, num_months

            #what's the first digit?
            np.random.normal(3, 1, num_months)

    what's this do?
    # Add an ARMA process to make this examle more real-world
    avg_lm_scores += sm.tsa.arma_generate_sample([1, -.2, -.1], [1], nsample=10)


What are the assumptions being made when doing this kind of analysis?

	Perallelism: The average change in target_variable in our treatment group would've been the same as the change in the target_variable in the control group.

	*a violation of the parallel assumption - which is what DID is founded on - is if something that's not related to our dependant variable impacted the one of the groups and not the other at the same time OR at all.

How would you interpret all the regression variables?
