How do we know if a time-series is non-stationary?

why BIC over AIC or Pacf?
what exactly is ARIMA doing that ARMA isn't?
    - p: is just lag window for the dependent variable. so if =5 
        then previous 5 terms will act as predictors
    - q: window size for the ma 
    - d: the number of differences. where =0 equal just the previous
    
how to detrend and decompose a time-series?
    - filters: kalman, hop-prescott
    - smoothing techniques: MA, rolling averages, ewma, wma 
    - removing seasonality
    - transformations: log, square or cube root
    - aggregating: resampling by a large unit of time

why did the stationarity fail?
    - overall trend
    - seasonality of weekdays


- fit ma model
- check whether or not the time series is stationary
- dickey-fuller test 

- decompose/detrend if necessary
    the overall idea behind this is to fit and forecast whatever values 
    after we've adjusted the time-series and the add back the affects 
    of the trend after we've made our forecast.
    
    - random variable transformations
        - log, square/cube root: if we need higher values 
        to be penalized more than smaller vals.
        
    - smoothing: rolling averages, ewma, wma
    - fittin a polynomial regression model
    - 'aggregating':resampling by a larger unit of time i.e. weekly/monthly
    
    - differencing: taking the difference between the data points 
        in the sequence i.e. p_0 - p_1
    - decomposition:
        - hop filter
        - kalman filter
    
    
    -- see if smoothing or aggregating works if not try differencing 
        or decomposition this works better when there's high seasonality.
    
    -- evaluation) 
    why not grid search the values that produce the best RSS?
    Take the original TS and calc the RMSE between the two also plotting them
    to see what the forcast looks like.
    
- fit arma model
    - box jenkins: find p, q s.t. min BIC and AIC DONE
    - there's also pacf and acf methods

- fit arima model: p, q, d s.t. min BIC and AIC * double check

- fit ma model
- fit ar model

- potentially contrive an exmaple anomaly and see how it does
