------------------

- start the journal of thoughts
	- I was fortunate to meet with a pretty awesome data scientist Drew
	- Trusting your internal compass may or may not lead to my success but i’ll living life on my own terms, which is much more satisfying
	- I will not interview with you if you ask me moronic questions: i.e. coin flipping\dice rolling, how many McDonalds there are in the US, questions directly out of ESL
	- Tell me the difference between data and information
	- scrape glass door questions and dedupe the 5 most popular
	- as I continued to study for my interviews I noticed my skill as a data scientist was starting to decay. That’s when I decided option a) continue down this ridiculous path of interviewing b) practice what I love doing with some hope of networking or a recruiter who actually knows what their doing my pay off. Naturally I went with continue to practice data science.
	- in the interview or over the phone. Get them to define the very problem they’re hiring you for. Get them to define the goals and timeline very clearly.
		- compose an approach robust plan and fire it back in an email. almost fully scoped out. depending on a few things.
