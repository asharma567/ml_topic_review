How do you handle outliers or data points that skew data?
    the first question you'd have to ask is this outlier a point that's an accurate representation of the distribution or is it a typo? if it's a typo throw it away.

How to find anomalies?
    what is an outlier?
        an observation that's exceptionally far from the mainstream of observations.
        it's careful to distinguish between i) extreme observations ii) observations made by errors eg typo, measurement

            if a data point isn't apart of any cluster and it's very distant from the rest of the clusters
        
        - 2-d scatter plots

    statistical approaches
        
        - value_counts 
            if theres very few repeats of the same data points, it's suspect
        - assuming a normal distribution, multiple of a std from the mean.
        - fitting a regression model using a cost function that's robust to outliers and calculating the residuals of each data point
        
        - max, min, average
            visually seeing how far

        - streaming data
            - mean shift
                calculating the average of some data feature and there's a stark shift in the average.
            - slope shift
            - max shift
            - can we use the median?

        extreme value analysis:
            typical hypothesis testing using z-test or student's t-test to see if an observation falls within some critical regions s.t. you can reject the null hypothesis with some level of confidence.

        probabalistic or statistical models:
            uses the expectation-maximizationg technique to check the probability of whether or not a data point belongs to a particular distribution. If it's a low probability it's labeled as an outlier. Down fall, these models assume a particular distribution.

        PCA:
            projecting the data onto a lower dimensional sub-space by way of linear correlation or covariance of the data. In this process a new axis is being calculated by the process of fitting linear plane through the data. The projection distance is what's being minimized, ie the distance orthogonal to the observation.

        Clustering:
            DBscan based on NN search or k-means and silhoutte score.
