The use-case of a recommender system is to predict the user-item rating s.t. it could ranked versus other items. It's broken down into two main core ideas i) predicting missing values of ratings on items a user hasn't seen yeet ii) maintaining a rank-ordering s.t. top-k items per user or top-k users for an item.
A good recommender system:
    - relevance
    - novelty
    - serendipity
        very similar to novely, it has the element of suprise where as novelty is like not to be recommended the same thing as last time
    - diversity
        not recommending the similar things in the top-k list. making sure the items are diverse from eachother makes sure it's not boring.

providing an explanation of why a user was recommended a particular trip could be useful
