- show that understand the question,
	- modeling choice informed by business constraints

first thing with a new dataset
- is there a data dictionary?
- what are the sources, how is the  data generated?
- what do all of these things mean
- data types
- strcuture of the data
- patterns of missingness
- cardinality

- visualizations, within columns, what's collinearity
- bivariate plots versus target
- variance

- rank the plots
- analyzing

These were the types of issues we had to deal with
