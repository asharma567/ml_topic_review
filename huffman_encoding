Huffman encoding
-----------------
- Makes a counter dictionary out of a vocab, then rank-orders by most frequent, and then compresses it with a bit string. This is used in word2vec to compress the size of the vocab.

- the idea is that the least frequent term is represented by the longest bit string, hence itâ€™s not a major ding on space complexity
