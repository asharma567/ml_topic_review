What are good upsampling methods?
	- rose
	- smote
	- noisy pca

What are the cost-benefit of each?
How are when to use?

Also remember to read it at work


ROSE draws "smoothed" bootstrap samples from the neighborhood
SMOTE draws from the area in periphy of hte neighborhood
	1) find an example of the minor class
	2) find it's nearest neigbor (assuming it's also in the minor class)
	3) take the difference
	4) multiply that difference by some fraction (0-1)
	5) add back to the subject sample which makes it the nearest neighbor

one vote for SMOTE as it's methods doesn't allow for it to produce unrealistic examples?

informative downsampling methods

EasyEnsemble --
samples with replacement with the majority and minority class and trains classifier to figure out which part of the major class it should remove.

BalanceCascade --
makes an ensemble classifier and systematically selects which major class examples to include
	How does it systematically select?

Lookup SMootboost, databoost

The ensemble method;
	- find k distinct clusters. Copy-paste your minor class to these distinct clusters and ensemble them

PR curve, cost curves as well. Specifically, cost curves are known to possess the ability to describe a classifierâ€™s performance over varying misclassification costs and class distributions in a visual format. In more than 90% instances, ROC curve is known to perform quite well
