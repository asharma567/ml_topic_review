Qs I've forgotten to ask:
- The frustrations of the role.
- Other non-trivial personality traits that are necessary for success in this role
- more about revenue stream composition
- Trend of projects in spam detection.. eg bots
- Once you do find a job have a deep understanding of the product and all the teams involved

- wear more blazers
- dress shoes or boat shoes or loafers
- mojo tends to win, gu chomps

- I do know if I try my hardset at something, it usually gives in.
