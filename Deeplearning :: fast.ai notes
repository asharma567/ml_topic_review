Deeplearning // fast.ai notes

when we're optimizing for precision in a highly imbalanced dataset, we probably shouldn't create synthetic samples of th minority class because, we need to very accurate in positive case

how do you downsample/upsample?
you need to maintain the distribution of the minority or majority class while doing so.

what's another way of arranging a sparse matrix for collab filter? (user/item or movie)

tuples: user_id, item_id, rating

encoding sometimes might not yield value in model performance but it'll yield it interpretation of the specific category that's driving the change

What's spearman's correlation?
how to find correlation amongst (multicollinearity)?
find the rank correlation where, data points are ranked against eachother adn then the ranks are plotted to see if there's collinearity in the rank.

The pitfall of using just correlation, it assumes linearity and most of the times two features are fairly correlated but might be 1:1 linear.

for the most part it's pretty much the same as standard r^2 correlation but ties are handled better with spearmen.

spearmen also ranks points very similar to the way RF does

Where and how do we use it?
when dropping redundant/multicollinear features from feature space. From the spearmen coefficient matrix, create a dendrogram, pickout the features which are pretty much the same and then run each pair though the leave feature out gap score process

what's partial dependence plot?
very much like hte shaply concept, what's the relationship between two variables holding all else equal?.. it's a clear way to visualize this relationship.
