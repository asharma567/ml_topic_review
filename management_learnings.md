Disagreements with introverts
This is a touchy subject because debates could quickly heat-up and gravitate to adversarial tones. This will hush people because the conversation begins to get uncomfortable. 
It's quite clear an unemotional tone must be use and the more negative the statement the more towards an understanding tone one should err. I think a solve for most things is aggessively soliciting for negative feedback.

Reporting lines need to be clear
There's some more evidence that reporting lines are extremely important and need to be very well established early on. It's difficult for some people to get other people to do things if they don't report into them.

More on hiring
Hiring based on mindset -- a higher order attribute -- than say specialties is much more powerful 
than say a familiarity with a package.

Cranking as opposed to producing
The concept of ranking is evident in alot of dev cultures where you're working so hard you're nearly burning out. Leadership 
misses the point of augmenting one's skills s.t. it's continually reaping greater rewards. That is, allocate some time for people to study and skill themselves up 
it returns in greater job satisfaction and producticity, if it's done in balance: 30% skill and 70% crank.
