# finding a file name with a certain desirable sub string while excluding other substrings

```
find . -iname "*helper*.py" -not -iname "*fft*" -not -iname "*joblib*" | uniq > delete.txt
```

OR 


```
find . -iname "*helper*.py" ! -iname "*fft*" ! -iname "*joblib*" | uniq > delete.txt
```
for whatever reason couldn't this couldn't be resolved in bash, ie the exclusions, so had to write a python script below. Uniq handles the dedpping 

python delete.py
```
with open('delete.txt') as f:
	
	lis = [line.strip() for line in f if 'fft' not in line and 'joblib' not in line and 'Trash' not in line and 'anaconda' not in line]
	
	with open('delete_filtered.txt','w') as b:
		b.write('\n'.join(lis))
```

Note subl subed in for open

```
head -2 delete_filtered.txt | xargs subl 
```

the above works but it'll exit on error hence leaving a lot of the lines unexecuted on

```
xargs -n 1 sh -c 'subl $0 || exit 255' < delete_filtered.txt
```

```
xargs -n 1 sh -c 'cat $0 || exit 0 ' < delete_filtered.txt >> output.txt
```

Finding a file in Bash
---------------------
find . | grep "file_name.ext"
rm -r delete_this
tail -100, head -150
cd, pwd, ls


find path/to/directory -name "*.py"
find . | grep "Slick.py"

locate -i "helpers.py"

locate -n 1 "helpers.py"

find / -type f -iname "helpers.py"

# find all files named  "Slick.py" and open them using sublime text
find . | grep "Slick.py" | xargs subl 

history | grep some_command
ssh
scp
time
echo
cat
sed
awk
pip list | grep psy

#line count
wc -l 
grep "this_text" from_this_file.txt | wc
