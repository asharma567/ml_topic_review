Academic credential don't really matter as much as you think: Someone could have a phd in machine learning and make an awful data scientist in practice.

In terms of philosophy and mindset of workflow:
	
	It's more similar to engineering vs product. 
	PM's are designed to be excellent multi-taskers (can jump in and out of attention span), lots of meetings, etc. This is not a good environment for a data scientist.

	All while, Data scientist are not the same as Software engineers. The workflows are completely different.




Hiring data scientist.
	I've written an entire post on the subject matter.
	Hiring the wrong the data scientist could be extremely toxic or helpful. We've seen what happens when we hire the wrong person, strain on product, strain on engineering, and they're expensive. That said, it's important to have a decently well thought-out vetting process.

The hardest part of data science?
	Asking good questions is both a science and an art. It has been
	described as the hardest task in data science. Understanding both
	the goals of your business (or client) and the limitations of your data
	seem to be key prerequisites to asking interesting questions.

Participants you interact with in the beginning
	“What does user success mean?”
	“We work with product managers and application engineers to define the metrics and have all the instru‐
	ments ready.”


- centralization
	-these people clearly need my help
	-break down of workflow and show where participants to interact with: research & analysis, prototyping.
	-show gina’s question
	-kb’s email
	-understanding the mindset
	-evaluation of work
	-show a diagram of where they need to sit
	-there isn’t a problem within the periphery of rt that I can’t solve
	-there isn’t a problem within the data space I can’t solve
	-there is some truth as an IC
	-better vetting
	-potentially solve the issue by having Ryan manage
	-the product is data, why shouldn’t data sci sit closer to product
	-it’s project specific, some products are consumer facing and some 
	-you should sit with who you’re going to interact with the most
	-point out the channel
	-ryan for the causality and then handing it off to Dan so he could have something to run with
