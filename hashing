How do hashing functions work?
	- doesn't support order 
		- heap, search tree
Why is it log n?

dealing with collisions
think about hashing functions in the context of domain and range.

Seperate chaining hash function
	is a way of collision handling when an element hashes to the same bucket. Each bucket is effectively a linked list and the head is the first node. this makes for easy insertions, deletions, additions.

	insertions in the front of the bucket

How convert a string to a hash code?
How to choose number of buckets?
	- the number of buckets can't share any factors with the hashing function.
	e.g. x mod 3 would be a terrible number for number of 30 buckets. Why because only 1/3 of th space would get filled.
	- solution: 
	i) pick a prime number
	ii) not too close to the power of 2 (of n)
	iii) not too close to the power of 10 (of n)

What is the purpose of a hashing function?
	- it's the distribute the incoming data uniformly as possible.

How does a hashing table work?
	It's a data structure that limits search space by unique hash keys per object stored

	You pass in some value, it converts it into a hash code then that code is passed into a hash function which looks up or allocates it to a bucket.

	There's a conversion function which I don't know anything about and there's a function which looks up a bucket given the code. 

	Assuming the code is some integer. It often time could be a modulus function with dividing value a function of the length of buckets. So if N is the number buckets the assignment would work like so--

	input_hash_code mod x some number less than n but not a factor of n and not prime.

	the hash function is also responsible for managing collisions and the uniform distribution of data through the.
