What is ES?
    - api available through amazon
    - it's a search tool which handles indexing and fuzzy-matching 
        - fuzzy matching: basic levenshtien distance with an error budget
        - bm125, tfidf: 
        - analyzer: tokenization custumization
    - not sure how it indexs but it's very fast. I remember it being similar to binary saerch tree in how autocompletes work.
