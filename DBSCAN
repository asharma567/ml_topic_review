DBSCAN issues:
	iterative sequence involves looking for the core points, border point, noise points.
	PROS:
		- searches for densities so it doesn't need a pre-specified number of clusters
		- can take on arbitrary shapes of clusters
	CONS:
		- defining a dense region can be arbitrary and cause for wrongly identifying clusters and missing clusters
		- eps is the variable you have to grid-search with min points in a sample
